## üöÄ Overview
ClipboardToFileInput is a Chrome extension that enables pasting clipboard content directly into file input fields on web pages. It's designed to address the inconvenience of not being able to do this natively in Google Chrome, a feature that OperaGX already offers.

Our goal is to release this on the Google Chrome Web Store soon! Once it's production-ready, the link will be available here. This extension will always remain open source, and updates on the Chrome Web Store version will be reflected in this repository.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Notice
**This extension CANNOT read your file system.** This means that pasting items from your file system is not possible due to Chrome's restrictive extension permissions. You can only paste content copied from within your browser or other applications.

Additionally, copying and pasting GIFs will likely not work. This is a long-standing [Chromium issue](https://issues.chromium.org/issues/40357537), which is beyond our control.
