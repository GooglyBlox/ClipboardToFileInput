# ClipboardToFileInput

## Overview
ClipboardToFileInput is a Chrome extension that enables pasting clipboard content directly into file input fields on web pages. It was made solely because it was extremely inconvenient not being able to do so on Google Chrome natively, since OperaGX is able to do so natively.

## Installation
1. Clone this repository or download the ZIP file.
2. Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`.
3. Enable Developer Mode.
4. Click 'Load unpacked' and select the extension directory.

## Usage
- Copy any file to your clipboard.
- Click on a file input field on any webpage.
- Click `Cancel` on the opened File Manager window.
- Press `Ctrl+V` (or `Cmd+V` on Mac) to paste the file.
